33 MINT JULEP
Juleps, although not mint juleps, have been with us for far longer than Kentucky has, probably since the seventeenth century. The word was also used by pharmacists to describe a sweet-tasting liquid that disguised the taste of an unpleasant medicine. I imagine that the first mint juleps could easily have been made to mask the flavor of a rough whiskey before the bourbon distillers, as we know them, had honed their craft.
Unlike most drinks, the mint julep has a tra- ditional serving day: the same as the Kentucky Derby. Every year on the first Saturday in May,

the mint julep is served nationwide at parties cel- ebrating the great race. There is some controversy, however, over whether or not to muddle the mint. Any drink that is served every year on the same day and can provoke a fight must be a classic.
The drink should really be served in a special sil- ver julep cup, which is shaped like a small tank- ard, but a highball or collins glass will do just fine, as long as the drink is served with style. Although someone is bound to argue with me, I contend that traditionally the mint is used only for bouquet, so make sure the leaves spill over the top of the glass, and use short straws so the drinker has to really bury his or her nose in the drink.

3 • BRANDY
“The thoroughbred in a field of nags” would ad- equately describe a fine brandy compared to most other liquors. In the realm of cocktails, brandy is found in such classics as the Sidecar, the Brandy Al- exander, and the Stringer. There is much controversy about what constitutes a brandy. I should tell you that the recipes in this chapter use as their base the gen- erally accepted brandy made from fermented wine. Drinks made from the much-debated fruit brandies appear in the Cordials chapter (page 268).
There are many tales told about the “invention” of brandy, and its true origin may never be known. Undoubtedly, though, it is the French who have re- fined and perfected the art of making this spirit.

One story tells of brandy being brought from Italy in 1533 to help celebrate the marriage of Cath- erine de Médicis. Mention of brandy from the Ar- magnac region of France, however, dates to 1411. In my mind, when the origin of anything is so unsure, credit should be given to the best story. The best story about the development of brandy in- volves a Dutchman.
This particular Dutchman, who was a shipmaster in the sixteenth century, was in the business of transporting wine from France to Holland. Being a wily sort, the man thought that by removing most of the water from the wine by means of distillation, he could concentrate it and thus ship much more wine per trip. He would make his fortune by adding the water back to the concentrate when it arrived in Holland.
Unfortunately for the poor soul, his friends tried the concentrated wine before he added the water to it and decided that to adulterate it would be a sin. They called it brandewijn, “burned wine,” and
through the years the name became shortened to brandy.
HOW TO SERVE BRANDY
A practice I abhor is that of warming brandy over a flame before serving it. This ritual actually burns off alcohol and contributes an artificially intense bouquet. Good brandy should be served at room temperature, in decent measure, in a snifter, prefer- ably made from quality crystal. The snifter should be held with the stem slotted between two fingers of the upturned palm, which cups the bottom of the glass. In this way the heat of the hand will warm the brandy, the aroma will gently lift from the sur- face, and the vapors will be captured at the lip of the glass. When drinking brandy, one’s nose or mouth should never be too far from the rim of the glass, lest that delectable mist be wasted on the fairies.
PRODUCTION
As described above, grape brandy is the product of the distillation of wine. It is made in just about every country that produces wine, so rules and reg- ulations about its production differ from place to place. Both pot stills and continuous stills can be used, although the pot still produces the better, al- beit more expensive, distillation. Sometimes brandy from both methods is “married” to produce a medium-price blend. The word brandy does not tell you where the product is from. Other more spe- cific names are often applied, such as Cognac and Armagnac, to describe the place of origin. These premium brandies are often governed by strict standards of production (see page 40).
FRUIT BRANDY
There are many different types of fruit brandies and exacting definitions can be tedious. I will endeavor to be brief.
The biggest controversy concerns products such as apricot brandy, which, for some reason, caused so much of an uproar with the U.S. legal authorities that they created a special category for them. These brandies must be made with a wine-brandy base, be over 70° proof, and contain a specified amount of sugar. In other countries, sweetened spirits made from fruits can be called brandies without contain- ing any wine brandy at all. When you buy fruit brandies, you may want to check the label; if there is no mention of the word brandy, then it probably is a fruit liqueur, but not necessarily an inferior product. It is all a matter of taste and government regulations.
Eau-de-vie, a French phrase that means, literally, “water of life,” generally refers to a distillation of any fruit other than the grape that has an alcohol content of around 100° proof. This spirit is almost always colorless, since it is either bottled immedi- ately after distillation, or stored in glass-lined casks or earthenware containers. This method of storage
retains the intense fruit flavor and maintains the high alcohol content.
Applejack, strictly an American product, was known in Prohibition times as “Jersey Lightning.” It is made from fermented apple cider, must be aged for a minimum of two years, and can be bottled as is or blended with neutral grain spirits.
Calvados, the French equivalent of applejack, is distilled from good-quality apple cider fermented for a minimum of one month (by which time all of the sugar has gone) and then aged, often as long as 20 to 40 years.
Other well-known fruit brandies and eaux-de- vie are kirsch or kirschwasser, made from cherries, Poire William from pears, Slivovitz from plums, framboise from raspberries, and fraise from straw- berries.
BRANDY-PRODUCING COUNTRIES AND REGIONS
Good brandies are produced in France, Spain, Greece, Germany, Italy, Australia, Portugal, Peru, Israel, Yugoslavia, and South Africa. In fact, one could safely say that wherever grapes are grown, wine and brandy are made.
COGNAC
Only brandy made from grapes grown in the de- limited district of France in the Charente know as Cognac may be named Cognac. The boundaries of this area were set down in 1909 and have since been subdivided into seven divisions of varying qual- ity. In order of preference they are: Grande Cham- pagne, Petite Champagne, Borderies, Fins Bois, Bons Bois, Bois Ordinaries, and Bois à Terroir.
All Cognac is made from wine that is fermented from whole grapes—skins, seeds, and all. The res- ulting wine is double-distilled in pot stills, and the
heart of the second distillation is destined to be- come Cognac. It is aged in new oak casks for one year, and then is transferred to used oak casks, lest it take on too much tannin from the virgin oak. (Tannin is what helps color spirits and imparts that dry, puckery feeling in your mouth.)
Labels on Cognac bottles use special abbrevi- ations that are designed to denote the quality of the spirit inside. Here is how it works:
V = Very
S = Special O = Old
P = Pale
F = Fine
X = Extra
C = Cognac E = Especial
When we put the letters together, however, they take on additional meanings. V.O. and V.S.O.P. both mean that the Cognac has been aged for at least four and a half years. V.S.O.P., however, is usually aged for at least eight years. If the label is printed with the words Extra, Napoléon, or Vieille Réserve, the French government warrants that the Cognac in that bottle has been aged for a minimum of five and a half years, not, as one may be tempted to believe, since the Battle of Waterloo.
Stars found on Cognac labels came from a su- perstitious shipper of brandy who put a star on his bottles to pay homage to a comet that appeared in 1811, a great year for Cognac. These days, French law states that three-star Cognac, the youngest, must be aged for a minimum of 18 months.
ARMAGNAC
This spirit, distilled mainly in Gascony in the south- west of France, is recognized as being the only
brandy to come close to the quality of Cognac. Indeed, some connoisseurs actually prefer the more pungent taste of Armagnac. It is distilled once, in a continuous copper still that was invented in the Armagnac region in the nineteenth century. Fre- quently, small farmers use a portable still, which is wheeled from farm to farm. It is then aged in black oak, which gives tannin and deep color to the brandy. The aging and labeling of Armagnac is done in much the same way as Cognac.
The region known as Armagnac is divided into three areas (in order of descending quality): Bas- Armagnac, Ténarèze, and Haut-Armagnac. Any bottle bearing only the word Armagnac, without mention of any of the regions, is a blend of two or all three regions.
AMERICAN BRANDY
Brandy was first made in the New World by the Spanish missions in California, and California is
still the major producer in the United States. By law, American brandy must be aged in wood, usu- ally oak, for a minimum of two years, although it may be made in either a pot still or the more eco- nomical continuous still. American brandy is gen- erally fruitier and somewhat lighter than European brandies.
GREEK BRANDY
Called koniak in Greece (pretty sneaky), most Greek brandy is distilled in Piraeus and Cyprus. The grapes used give this brandy a distinctive fla- vor, which usually is then sweetened with caramel.
SPANISH BRANDY
This rich, dark, sweet brandy is produced mainly in Jerez and Valdepeñas. Although some are distilled from sherry, most Spanish brandies are made from other Spanish wines.

4 • GIN
The word gin is merely a corruption of the Dutch for juniper—jenever—or from the French word for juniper—genièvre. Gin is a versatile yet distinctive beverage, the main ingredient in a Tom Collins, a Martini, and a Singapore Sling. Gin, a wonderfully perfumed potion, is probably the most notorious of liquors, and, for some reason, gin drinkers are seen as serious drinkers, people who like the taste of al- cohol and do not try to disguise it. This attitude is much appreciated by gin distillers, who go to great lengths to make their gin distinctive and jealously guard their recipes.
Gin was first developed in the seventeenth century by a Dutch doctor, who combined alcohol with the juniper berry to concoct a remedy for kidney com- plaints. Apparently, although it did nothing for the

kidneys, the “tonic” was very popular due to its amnesia-inducing qualities. It made the patient for- get or, at the very least, not care about his com- plaint.
Then came William III, another Dutchman, who married Mary II and became King of England in 1689. William had a personal grudge against the French because they were threatening his native Holland. Vengefully he raised excise duties on all French wines and brandies. This action made gin, the cheaper Dutch liquor, more accessible to the English public, thus hurting the French and benefit- ing Holland in one fell swoop.
His adopted country took to the gin very quickly. They were soon making it themselves, and for a large part of the eighteenth century, gin became the solace of the English poor. Soldiers drank it before going into battle, and their drunken bravery came to be known as “Dutch Courage.” Juniper berries were erroneously believed to have the power to induce abortion, and thus gin earned the name “Mother’s
Ruin.” If a person was living a debauched life, he was said to be on “Gin Lane.”
All things considered, it is quite amazing that such a maligned drink is still with us, but gradually, gin became more socially acceptable, and today we have available to us a wide variety of distinctive gins. The next time you have a Martini, you may consider raising your glass to William III. Without him, you might be drinking straight vermouth.
PRODUCTION
1.	Generallyspeaking,today’sginismadeby infusing juniper and other flavorings into a high-quality, neutral grain spirit.
2.	This spirit is made in a continuous still from wort, a liquid made, in the case of gin, by boiling and fermenting corn with malted barley and a small amount of another grain.
3. Theinfusionisusuallyachievedbymeans of distilling the spirit along with the flavor- ings in a pot still.
DRY GIN
If you order any standard gin drink, the gin that’s poured will be dry gin, unquestionably the most popular type of gin. All distillers use juniper berries and coriander seed in their dry gin recipes, but other flavorings may include fennel, calamus root, or- ris root, angelica root, almond, cardamom, cassia, ginger, cinnamon, licorice, caraway seeds, orange and lemon peels, and perhaps some other secret in- gredients that the distillers just won’t talk about. This collection of flavorings is known as the “botanicals.”
The botanicals either are added to the neutral spirit in a pot still before the spirit is redistilled, or they may be suspended in the tower of the still so that the spirit vapors absorb their flavors. The
“two-shot” method of distilling dry gin calls for a much larger proportion of botanicals, and the res- ulting, highly flavored liquor is then mixed with un- flavored neutral grain spirit to produce the correct strength.
In America, dry gin may be made by adding the botanicals to the original distillation of the wort or even by adding oils or extracts from juniper and other botanicals to neutral grain spirits. The second method produces compound gin, which cannot be called distilled gin.
DUTCH GIN
Dutch gin, also known as “Hollands gin” or “Genever gin,” is made by infusing juniper and some, but not many, other botanicals into malt wine. Malt wine is a neutral grain spirit made from equal amounts of malted barley, corn, and rye. These products are boiled, and the resulting wort is allowed to ferment for a few days before being dis-
tilled in a pot still. The resulting liquor may be re- distilled once or twice before finally being distilled in another pot still with the botanicals. Sometimes this liquor is then diluted with grain spirit from a continuous still to make the product less expensive.
The two main types of Dutch gin are oude and jonge, old and young. Jonge contains much less malt wine and much more continuous still grain spirit. The slight golden color found in many Dutch gins comes from a small amount of coloring added to the final product.
OLD TOM
Old Tom, rarely produced anymore, is a sweet gin that is made in England. It is said to have been the gin used to make the original Tom Collins. In ad- dition to that lovely bit of trivia, Old Tom comes equipped with a wonderful legend. The tale told is that Old Tom gin was first distilled by Captain Dud- ley Broadsheet in eighteenth-century London. The
captain used a carving of a tomcat as his shop sign and, I was amazed to hear, as his dispenser. The buyer would put his money into the cat’s mouth and hold a receptacle under one of the cat’s paws. Broadsheet would watch how much money was be- ing spent and pour the appropriate amount of gin in- to a pipe that ran through the leg of his cat and into the buyer’s glass. Personally, I would buy the dear captain’s gin just to see the show.
PLYMOUTH GIN
Plymouth gin is made by only one distiller and is completely unsweetened. It was rumored that a small amount of sulfuric acid was added to Ply- mouth gin before it was distilled, but I cannot find any corroboration for this allegation. Plymouth gin is the traditional gin of the British Navy, and it is the gin of preference for an authentic Pink Gin.

139 GIMLET
Originally a British concoction from the Far East, the gimlet combines two ingredients that probably spring immediately to mind with the very mention

of the word British: gin and lime. Was it first made with fresh lime juice or Rose’s lime juice, which is concentrated and sweetened? We shall probably never know, but since the Rose’s product has had such a long and impressive history (which predates the gimlet), I am inclined to think that Rose’s was the ingredient that invented the drink.
Rose’s lime juice was first concocted by Lauchlin Rose of Scotland in 1867 and was sold to shipping companies as a preventative remedy for scurvy. This helpful and profitable sale of his product also served to introduce Rose’s lime juice wherever the ships were headed throughout the world. It was first exported to America in 1901.
Variations on the gimlet include the Rum Gimlet (page 128), Tequila Gimlet (page 171), and Vodka Gimlet (page 198).

173 MARTINI
The martini is one of the simplest of drinks—smooth, dry, lightly perfumed (depending

on which gin you prefer)—and it is a classic aper- itif. The martini bespeaks an air of sophistication; it is an acquired taste that can be altered to suit the individual. It may be the classic cocktail.
However, the martini also seems to give a drink- er a chance to boast of his or her individuality. Some say that one should merely introduce the bottle of vermouth to the gin, very politely of course: “Mr. Gin, allow me to introduce Mr. Ver- mouth. Don’t shake hands now; you will never mix.” Showman bartenders will keep the vermouth in an atomizer and merely spray the glass lightly before adding chilled gin. Others will keep their olives soaking in the vermouth, negating the need for any extra in the mixing glass. James Bond pre- ferred his martini shaken, not stirred, but that can “bruise” the gin. Bruise the gin? I imagine that one can bruise an olive, but, personally, I don’t believe that gin can be bruised. There seems to be no end of special treatments required for some people’s mar- tinis. They’ll easily choose between straight up or on the rocks, and generally the choice between a
twist and an olive won’t challenge them too much. But then the peculiarities begin: They’ll want the martini straight up with a glass of ice cubes on the side, two olives put in the glass before the drink is poured in, or the twist must be rubbed around the rim of the glass, waved twice over the top, and then thrown away. No request is too bizarre.
Of course, these days, you can make a martini with any white liquor at all—rum, tequila, gin, or vodka. The martini offers true freedom of choice: It might just be the very symbol of America. Put three cocktail onions into the drink, instead of the olive or twist, and it becomes a Gibson. Use a dash of Scotch instead of the vermouth, and you have a Sil- ver Bullet. Use saké, and you have a Sakétini, and, of course, if you make a martini with Scotch instead of gin and sweet vermouth instead of dry, the drink becomes a Rob Roy.
Variations on the Martini include the Fino Martini (page 70), Rum Martini (page 128), Sakétini (page 89), Silver Bullet (page 90), Tequila
Martini (page 171), Vodka Martini (page 198), Rob Roy (page 150), and the Gibson (page 71).

207 SINGAPORE SLING
A drink that has changed enormously over the years, the original Singapore Sling was concocted at the Raffles Hotel in Singapore. It had equal amounts of gin, Bénédictine, and cherry brandy ad- ded to some club soda. Some folks, however, claim that it was first made with a few drops of brandy and Bénédictine, together with two parts gin to one part of cherry brandy and one part lime juice. These are indeed superb drinks, and they deserve

mention alongside the recipe for what is now com- monly accepted as a true Singapore Sling. See re- cipes for The Original Singapore Sling and The Other Original Singapore Sling on page 85.

211 TOM COLLINS
Which came first, Tom Collins or John? I don’t really know, although I suspect that it was actually John. Here is my reasoning: A Tom Collins is named after Old Tom Gin, which has been around since the early eighteenth century (see Gin, page 58). A John Collins was probably named after some bartender during the Civil War. It is made with bourbon, which has been around only since the late eighteenth century (see Bourbon, page 21). Since Americans are largely responsible for “inventing” cocktails in the first place, I choose to believe that the first “Collins” was a John Collins, concocted during the Civil War and later copied using Old Tom Gin. This drink was, of course, known as a Tom Collins in a reference to the gin.
Variations on the Tom Collins include the John Collins (page 30) and the Vodka Collins (page 197).

5 • RUM
Christopher Columbus did much more than discover the Americas; he also brought sugar cane to the West Indies. This gave all of those pirates of yesteryear a darned good base from which to make some liquor and, ultimately, gave us cocktails such as the Cuba Libré, the Bacardi Cocktail, and the Daiquiri. For trade purposes, rum was the best way for the Spanish settlers to store their sugar cane, since, when dis- tilled, it would not deteriorate with age as would the fresh product.
The derivation of the word rum is unknown. It may have come from saccharum, Latin for “sugar,” but personally, I find that explanation a little mundane. I think the drink took on the word British sailors originally used to describe it—rum. Rum is a word still used in parts of England as an adjective.

A “rum lad” is a man known for being a good sort of a chap, if somewhat of a daredevil or prank- ster, and this word dates back to the seventeenth century. In the early part of the eighteenth century, British sailors were given Barbados Water to com- bat scurvy. Naming the drink “rum” would seem to make sense when the drink was a good, if some- what daring, way of combating a fatal disease.
PRODUCTION
Raw sugar cane is pressed between rollers to extract juice. The juice is boiled down, clarified, and put into machines that spin around at a ferocious rate, crystallizing the sugar and separating it from the residue, which is molasses. The molasses is re- boiled, yielding a low-grade sugar, and the residue is then mixed with water and yeast, allowed to fer- ment, and then distilled to produce rum.
Rums are divided into four main categories: light, medium, full-bodied, and aromatic. Rum
bottles must, by law, state their country of origin, and, although each country is usually connected to a certain type of rum, Jamaican rum does not have to be full-bodied, and Puerto Rican rum is not ne- cessarily light. Añejo rum simply means “aged” rum; it usually has a tawny color and more mellow flavor.
PUERTO RICAN RUM
During the distillation process, small amounts of the “mash” from the previous distillation are added to the new batch, similar to the method employed in making sour mash whiskey. After the mash has fer- mented for a few days, it is distilled in a continuous still and then aged in oak casks. The casks may or may not be charred depending on the type of rum desired.
The rum must be aged for at least a year to produce a light-bodied, dry rum. Amber or golden rums from Puerto Rico are aged for a minimum of
three years and have caramel added to enhance the color gained from the casks. If the rum is aged for over six years, it may be designated as vieux or li- queur rum.
VIRGIN ISLANDS RUM
The Virgin Islands generally produce a dry, light- bodied rum similar to Puerto Rican light rum.
DEMERARAN RUM
From Guyana, this rum is very dark and yet has only medium body. It is often bottled with a very high alcohol content (151° proof), and is the rum traditionally used in a Zombie (see Tropical Drinks, page 244).
JAMAICAN RUM
The molasses used to make a good, full-bodied Ja- maican rum is naturally fermented for about three
weeks. Natural fermentation means that yeast from the air, as opposed to cultured yeast, settles on the surface of the mash, which is supplemented by mash from previous distillations. It is double-dis- tilled in pot stills and aged in oak casks for a min- imum of five years. The color of Jamaican rum, however, comes more from the amount of caramel added than from the cask.
MARTINIQUE AND HAITIAN RUM
These rums are distilled from the juice of the sugar cane rather than from molasses. The juice is con- centrated and distilled in pot stills; the rum is then aged in oak casks from which it takes its color. The final product is medium-bodied.
BATAVIA ARAK
The production of this aromatic rum from the island of Java is absolutely intriguing. Small cakes are made from Javanese red rice; these are put into the
molasses, which then ferments naturally (see Ja- maican rum). The distilled rum is aged for around three years in Java and then shipped to Holland, where it is further aged for up to six years before being blended and bottled. Batavia refers to the town where the arak (rum) is made.
AGUARDIENTE DE CAÑA
This is the name given to most rums from South America. The best known among them in America is cachaça, from Brazil. Cachaça is the main in- gredient of a Caipirinha, a wonderful sweet-and- sour Brazilian cocktail.

The town of Daiquiri, Cuba, gave its name to the popular and refreshing rum cocktail that originated there in 1898. The town’s doctors were at a loss as to how to combat an outbreak of malaria. The only “medicine” available to them was the local rum, which they hoped would help ward off the fever. American engineers who were working for the local mining company added lime juice and sugar to the rum to make it more palatable. They added ice cubes from distilled water, shook it up, and enjoyed their medicine, as much then as people do today.

6 • SCOTCH
Without Scotch, the peaty whisky from the land of swirling kilts and bellowing bagpipes, there would be no Rusty Nail, no Godfather, and no Rob Roy, and the world would be a sadder place. The word Scotch defines a whisky and cannot be applied to just any old object or person hailing from Scotland (known as Scottish).
The art of distillation probably was introduced to Scotland by Irish monks who themselves learned the process from the Spaniards. They brought it to the west coast of Scotland when seeking to convert the then “heathen” Scot. It probably went a long way to convincing the Scots that Christianity was a fine re- ligion.

In 1643 excise taxes were introduced to Scot- land, and many distillers fled to the hills to escape the grasp of the tax man. These distilleries were often protected by the local citizens and were still in widespread use up until the early 1800s, when another law was introduced prohibiting the use of any still with a capacity of less than 500 gallons. Using a little tact and diplomacy this time, the gov- ernment managed to convince the illegal distillers that if their stills were legally recognized, then they could sell their product to a far larger audience.
The continuous still (also known as the Coffey or the patent still; see page 22) was introduced in 1831, making the production of whisky much easi- er and far quicker. Competition between distilleries became rife, and Scotch was exported for the first time.
Prohibition played a large part in making Scotch popular in America. A certain Captain McCoy, a famous Prohibition-era smuggler, guaranteed that any Scotch bought from him was the real thing.
That’s how the term “the real McCoy” entered our language.
PRODUCTION
Blended Scotches have long been popular in Amer- ica. “Single malt” Scotch gained much popularity in the late 1980s. In defining the production pro- cesses involved in making Scotch, it is easiest to describe each “category” separately, starting with the “single malt,” the pure, unblended form.
SINGLE MALT SCOTCH
Single malt Scotch is made entirely from malted barley, that is, barley that has been germinated to release fermentable sugars and then heated to stop the germination process. The malt is then milled and “mashed,” mixed with warm water in a “mash- tun,” to complete the conversion of starches to fer- mentable sugars. The liquid is strained and be- comes known as “wort.” Yeast is added to the wort,
and the resulting fermentation yields alcohol. The fermented wort is distilled in pot stills to produce single malt Scotch. Finally it is poured into oak sherry or bourbon casks for aging.
It was not until the late nineteenth century that the Scots discovered that aging their single malts made a vast difference in the taste. Legally, single malt must be aged for at least three years, although it is rare that a distiller will offer it for sale under five years old. The popular standard is to give malt whisky 12 years of barrel aging, until it is mature and has soaked up the flavors from the casks. Many experts say that after 15 years the Scotch begins to take on the flavor of the wood rather than the sherry or bourbon. Wood flavors are not desirable. This group prefers single malts aged no more than 15 years. Others believe that some heartier distillations can withstand 18 to 25 years of aging without suf- fering any ill effects whatsoever.
Just like a fine Cognac or a vintage wine, the single malt Scotch offers bouquet, palate, and fin-
ish, and therefore, each one can be properly savored and judged on these aspects. The differences among single malt Scotches come from many variants within each distillery and its location. The deciding factors include:
1.	The water from which they are made. Distilleries are located near the springs and wells that supply the water for the Scotch. They are built because of the quality of the nearby water, and that water is not treated before it is used in the distilling process. Ideally, the water used distilling single malts rises from granite and flows over peat.
2.	The peat, a type of moss over which the water flows. In some cases, the peat also is used in the kilns to stop the malting pro- cess. The flavor of the peat differs from area to area, helping make each district and even each distillery produce a Scotch that is peculiar to itself.
3.	The air surrounding the casks during mat- uration. Since the casks breathe the air, the atmospheric characteristics of the region are infused into the Scotch giving, for ex- ample, Islay Scotches an undertone of sea air or iodine.
4.	The shape of the pot still. This factor is so important that when a still must be re- placed, it is copied right down to the last dent that some careless welder may have put into the original one in 1824! Tall towers on the pot still tend to produce lighter Scotches, whereas short, squat towers produce a heavier, oilier Scotch.
5.	The casks in which they are aged. Oak casks are always used, but since virgin oak imparts too much vanilla flavor, the casks used for aging single malts are bought from bourbon or sherry distillers. The single malt, therefore, takes on some of the flavor of the previous occupant of the cask. Some malts are aged in bourbon casks, some in
sherry casks, and some are started in bour- bon and finished in sherry.
In addition to these influences, the heather or the sea-weed in the peat, the microflora in the wood of the tun-room, and some say even the color of the distiller’s tartan make a difference, too. Indeed, the possibilities are mind boggling, and these variants make the single malt intriguing to connoisseurs.
Single malt Scotches are usually divided into four regions: Highlands, Lowlands, Islay, and Cam- beltown. The Highlands can be further broken down since the area is so large, and in addition to Islay, there are other Scotch-producing is- lands—Skye, Mull, Jura, and Orkney. Scotches from these small areas can be hard to find in the United States and, since they are few, are almost impossible to regionalize.
I give here a generalization of the characteristics of each area. Remember, these are not descriptions of the brand names used as examples; these brands
serve only as a guideline to help you choose a Scotch representative of each area. Each individual single malt Scotch differs from the next.
The Lowlands yield soft, sweetish, fruity malts re- lying less on peat and granite springs and more on the flavor of the malt itself. Try Auchentoshen, Glenkinchie, or Ladyburn.
Cambeltown produces briny, salt-sweet Scotch, drawing on the sea air for much of its character. This Scotch usually imparts a light peatiness along with a fresh palate. Try Springbank or Longrow.
Islay delivers a very distinctive product drawing on the sea air that not only permeates the casks, but is also responsible for the flavor imparted from the peat. These malts are known for having an iodine and peaty flavor, some say almost medicinal. Try Bunnahabhain, Laphroaig, or Lagavulin.
Speyside is often referred to as the Rolls-Royce of Scotch-producing regions. A delimited area of the Highlands, Speyside runs roughly between the cit-
ies of Iverness and Aberdeen. The whiskies from this region are diverse within themselves and actu- ally can be divided into smaller areas within Spey- side. Generally, however, they tend toward being smoky and full-bodied; many are aged totally in sherry casks and therefore impart sweetness from the sherry. Try The Macallan, The Singleton, or Glenlivet.
Western Highland Scotches are few and therefore hard to categorize. They are generally firm and dry with some peatiness. Try Oban or Glengoyne.
Northern Highland malts draw from the sea air and the heather-packed soil to produce Scotch that is both spicy and flowery. Try Glenmorangie, Dal- more, or Glenordie.
Eastern Highlands produce sweet, fruity single malts that are ideal after dinner. Try Lochnagar or Glen Garioch.
The Southern Highland or Midland region tends to be better known for its blended Scotches, such as
Dewar’s and Famous Grouse. Malts from this dis- trict tend to be fruity, medium sweet, and nutty. Try Edradour or Glenforres (vatted).
VATTED MALT SCOTCH
This is a blend of single malt Scotches from a vari- ety of distilleries. No whisky from continuous stills is added. These Scotches tend to be more consistent than regular single malts, since the proportions used in the blending process can be fine-tuned to guaran- tee the exact same flavor as the previous bottling.
BLENDED SCOTCH
These Scotches use a proportion of several single malt Scotches that are blended with whisky dis- tilled in continuous stills from unmalted barley or corn. The continuous still is more effective than the pot still, but the resulting liquor is correspondingly less flavorful.

7 • TEQUILA
This unique briny liquor, made exclusively in Mex- ico from the agave plant, gives us the base for a Mar- garita, the Brave Bull, and, of course, the Tequila Sunrise. It is a romantic, daring drink, which bears a distinctive dry taste that lends itself to producing a strain of cocktails peculiar to tequila. Tequila ac- quired a cult status in the 1950s, when the erroneous rumor that it contained mescaline coupled with its romantic rituals made it a favorite with “hip” Cali- fornians. The drink was then incorporated into the aforementioned popular cocktails, as well as many others, and the demand for tequila extended throughout the States.
For at least one thousand years before Spain in- vaded Mexico, the Aztecs were drinking pulque, a low-alcohol wine made from the mezcal plant; it

is still consumed in Mexico today. Along came the Spaniards in the early part of the sixteenth cen- tury, bringing with them the art of distillation, and tequila was born. Pulque was used by the Aztecs in many rituals, and, indeed, tequila is well known as a drink of ritual, being consumed straight with salt and lime in a ceremony seen in bars throughout the world. (The ritual is described in detail in this chapter under Tequila Cruda, page 170.)
Tequila was first imported legally to the United States in the 1870s. It was further promoted by American soldiers defending Zapata’s raids during the Mexican Revolution in 1916. Prohibition also helped tequila gain popularity in the States. Since it was distilled legally in Mexico, tequila only had to be smuggled over the border to quench the thirst of deprived Americans.
PRODUCTION
The base of a mature agave plant is steamed in or- der to extract the sap. The sap ferments for about 10 days, producing “mother pulque”. This is then ad- ded to fresh sap and allowed to ferment, producing pulque (wine). The pulque is then double-distilled in pot stills, and the resultant vino mezcal. can be exported immediately as a “white” liquor, or it may be aged in oak casks to produce an añejo or aged product.
For tequila aficionados, let’s set the record straight on mezcal and tequila. Tequila is to mezcal what Cognac is to brandy; that is, tequila is a su- perior form of mezcal. Tequila is produced only in two designated regions of Mexico, one surround- ing the town of Tequila, the other in the area of Te- patitlan. Mezcal is produced in numerous regions throughout Mexico.
While tequila is made only from a blue-colored agave plant, specifically Agave tequilana weber, mezcal can be made from different varieties of agave. Production of tequila is governed by strin-
gent quality standards that are not applied to mezc- al. Ordinary tequila is considered “white” tequila.
GOLD TEQUILA
There are no Mexican regulations governing the aging of this product, although most producers claim that it is aged in white oak casks for two to four years.
TEQUILA AÑEJO
This “aged” tequila must be aged for a minimum of one year in white oak casks.

Wax-lined vats are used to age this product, which is mellower than ordinary (white) tequila but still has no color.

452 MARGARITA
These days Margaritas come in a variety of colors and flavors—blue, peach, mango—none of them bearing much resemblance to the pure, original cocktail that spread through California in the early part of the twentieth century. One thing certain about the Margarita is that it was named for a wo- man; exactly which woman and what she did to earn the accolade is arguable. One Mexico City- born señorita claims that she was the inspiration for the drink in the 1930s, while another lady claims it was first concocted for her in the 1950s in Acapulco. I think that both stories are absolutely true, and I wish both women, and any others out there who claim to be the Margarita, all the best and my heartfelt congratulations. The Margarita is indeed a wonderful creation.
Variations on the Margarita include the Blue Margarita (page 159), Frozen Margarita (page 162), Gold Margarita (page 163), Peach Margarita (page 167), and Strawberry Margarita (page 170).

Word has it that this drink was concocted by a befuddled bartender in San Francisco, who had stayed at the bar drinking with a few friends until the boss walked in at around 9:00 A.M. The bar owner demanded an explanation, and the drunken bartender explained that he had stayed to watch the sun rise so that he could create a drink that re- sembled the occurrence. Of course, he had to pro- duce the drink in order to prove his story, and to his credit, he quickly built a Tequila Sunrise. Yes, it sounds pretty unlikely to me, too. A variation on the Tequila Sunrise is the Executive Sunrise (page 162).

8 • VODKA
Once referred to as a “necklace of negatives,” vodka, the base of the Screwdriver, Bloody Mary, and the Kamikaze, is immediately recognizable for its dis- tinct lack of aroma, color, and taste. The word vodka comes from the diminutive of the Russian word voda, meaning “water,” making it “little water.” Little water with a big kick.
Vodka is mentioned in twelfth-century Russian lit- erature, but at that time the name was used to refer to any spirit, no matter what it was distilled from or how highly flavored it was. The spirit, as we know it, was probably concocted in fourteenth-century Rus- sia. It didn’t come to America until the 1930s when the Smirnoff family arrived with their recipe and set up, once again, in the distillery business. The pro- duction of vodka in Russia was banned by the czar at

the start of World War I, and, by the time it was once again legalized, the state had taken control of all industry.
There is a romantic Russian ritual of smashing glasses in the fireplace after consuming vodka to ensure that whatever toast has just been made will come true. A manager from the Russian Samovar Restaurant in New York City told me that a famous Russian poet was visiting Robert Kennedy and to- gether they drank a toast to life with Russian vodka. Ethel Kennedy refused to let them smash the glasses, which were family heirlooms, but she brought, in their stead, some plastic glasses to break. The plastics merely bounced around the fire- place.
PRODUCTION
Vodka can almost be made from whatever happens to be lying around—beets are used in Turkey, while Britain tends to favor molasses—though most
vodka is produced from potatoes, corn, and wheat. It is distilled at a very high alcohol content and then filtered through vegetable charcoal. The better ones are filtered through activated charcoal or very fine quartz sand.
GOLD VODKA
This spirit, referred to as Stárka or “old,” is simply vodka that has been aged in wine casks for around 10 years.
PEPPER VODKA
Known as Pertsovka, this fiery hot Russian vodka is infused with cubeb, cayenne, and capsicum. This style of vodka is said to come from Czar Peter the Great, who added pepper to his vodka.
There are other classic flavored vodkas such as Yubileyneya Osobaya, containing honey and brandy, and Okhotnichya, which is infused with a
collection of herbs. And, as I write this, there is probably some well-meaning entrepreneur about to infuse vodka with a mixture of Chinese tea leaves and banana peel. That is actually the beauty of vodka: It lends itself to being flavored with whatever the drinker wishes.

491 BLOODY MARY
I have heard only two explanations for the name of this drink. One is that it was named after Mary I of England, a sixteenth-century queen who was nicknamed Bloody Mary because of the number of people that she had put to death. It is quite cer- tain that nobody drank vodka and tomato juice be- fore Mary got her epithet, so I prefer this explan- ation to the one that gives credit to the character

in the 1949 musical South Pacific who was desig- nated bloody because her teeth were stained red from chewing betel nuts.
Of course, given the way English royalty used to have people killed, it is somewhat surprising that we don’t have a whole lineage of drinks named Bloody Ethelred, Bloody Henry, Bloody Richard, and Bloody Harold. I imagine that the Brits only gave the title to Mary because such behavior was unbecoming to a female.
As to who first concocted the Bloody Mary, well, many different people have taken credit, but it is usually credited to a bartender at Harry’s New York Bar in Paris during the 1920s. His name was Fernand Petiot.
You may want to make a batch of Bloody Marys if you are throwing a brunch or a breakfast party. If so, make the tomato juice mixture without the vodka. That way the mix won’t separate, and non- drinkers can help themselves to Virgin Marys.
Variations on the Bloody Mary include the Bloody Bull (above), Bloody Maria (page 158), and Clamato Cocktail (page 182).

9 • WHISKEY
The word whiskey comes from the Gaelic word uis- gebaugh, which means “water of life.” If you say “uisgebaugh” quickly (if you can say it at all), it comes out something like WYS-GER-BAW, which was shortened and Anglicized to “whiskey.” Whis- key is made from grain; the types and proportion of grains together with the different aging processes de- termine each whiskey’s style and flavor.
The cocktails in this chapter contain a base of either blended American whiskey, Canadian whisky, or Irish whiskey; they include cocktails like the Manhattan, the Old-Fashioned, and the Presbyterian. There are many different varieties of American whiskies—wheat, sour mash, Tennessee, rye, corn, malt, rye malt, and bourbon. All of them fall under one or more of the headings straight, blended, or

light whiskies. Bourbon and sour mash are de- scribed in the Bourbon chapter; the rest are defined here.
WHISKEY AND WHISKY
Here’s another wonderful bar discussion—the e in “whiskey.” This e is used only in spelling the names of Irish and American whiskies. There is, of course, an exception here, and it lies with a brand of bour- bon known as Maker’s Mark. The founder of the distillery, Mr. Samuels, was given special permis- sion to drop the e from his whisky in order to pay homage to his Scottish heritage.
PRODUCTION
All whiskies undergo a similar basic distillation process:
Grain is ground into a product known as “grist” in a gristmill.
Water is added to the grist, and it is cooked to release starches.
Malt is added to convert the starches into sug- ar.
The grist is strained off, and the remaining li- quid, “wort,” is fed with cultured yeast and al- lowed to ferment, which results in an alcohol- ic liquid known as beer.
This beer is then distilled in either a pot still or a continuous still—often called a Coffey still, patent still, or double-column still—to produce whiskey.
The whiskey is then watered down to around 100° proof (50 percent alcohol) and aged in a variety of types of barrels, determined by the type of whiskey being made.

As far as is known, the first whiskey in the New World was distilled in the Northeast during the Re- volutionary War, during which the British set up naval blockades that stopped the supply of rum from the West Indies and Cuba—probably the cruelest move the British could have made.
Initially, American whiskey was made from the abundant rye and barley, and later on, as people moved westward, corn. The farmers of that era found that using their grain for the production of whiskey was the best way to make it a viable, trans- portable product for sale in the cities in the East.
American whiskey is usually aged in oak barrels that have been charred on the inside. Just how this method came about is unsure. Some say that it was the result of a fire in a cooperage, after which the charred barrels had to be used since no others were available. Others claim that it resulted from the practice of burning out barrels previously used for fish or molasses to rid the cask of the flavor and odor of the previous occupant.
STRAIGHT WHISKEY
This term simply means that the whiskey it de- scribes—bourbon, Tennessee, corn, rye, malt, mal- ted rye, or wheat—is a bottling of a distillation that has not been blended with any other whiskey or neutral grain spirit. Water, of course, is always ad- ded to a distillation to bring the proof down to the desired level. Any “straight” whiskey must be dis- tilled from a 51 percent base of a single grain, the type of grain being dependent on the type of whis- key.
BLENDED WHISKEY
The word blended is applicable to about 47 percent of all American whiskies. Each blend contains a minimum of 20 percent straight whiskey, mixed with neutral grain spirit, grain spirit (aged in used oak barrels), or light whiskey. A blended whiskey may also contain a small amount of sherry, or peach or prune juice.
LIGHT WHISKEY
Usually made from a very high percentage of corn, light whiskey is aged in uncharred casks or previ- ously used casks. This practice serves a great pur- pose. It gives the bourbon distillers someone other than the Scots to sell their used casks to (see Bour- bon, page 22). This product may be bottled as light whiskey or blended light whiskey.
RYE WHISKEY
This term can be applied only to whiskies made from a mash containing a minimum of 51 percent rye. The category can be split into straight rye and blended rye, although blended rye can contain neut- ral grain spirit or whiskey made from grain other than rye.
TENNESSEE WHISKEY
This whiskey absolutely must be made in Tenness- ee. It must also be made from at least 51 percent of any one grain, usually corn.
CORN WHISKEY
As opposed to bourbon, which must use a minimum of 51 percent corn, corn whiskey must use at least 80 percent corn and is aged in previously used or uncharred oak casks.
WHEAT, MALT, AND RYE MALT WHISKEY
All of these whiskeys must contain, respectively, 51 percent wheat, barley malt, or rye malt grains.
CANADIAN WHISKY
Canadian whisky must be produced only from cer- eal grain, such as corn, rye, wheat, or barley. The
actual percentages used by the individual distillers aren’t specified by law as they are in the United States. The American government, however, insists that all imported Canadian whiskies be designated as “blended” as opposed to “straight”.
IRISH WHISKEY
Ireland generally employs similar methods of distil- lation to Scotland (see Scotch, page 138) with one or two variations. The main difference is that Irish whiskey is normally distilled three times in a pot still, whereas Scotch is distilled only twice (except in a few cases in the Lowlands). Irish whiskey is sweeter and not as peaty as many Scotches, and it is usually blended with whiskey made from a continu- ous still, although there are single malt Irish whis- keys available.
The single malt Irish whiskies are made purely from malted barley, whereas, like Scotch, the whis- key used in blending can be made from unmalted
barley, corn, rye, wheat, or oats. Irish whiskey is generally aged for a minimum of five years in used sherry casks.
POTEEN
Usually pronounced PO-CHEEN, this word comes from the Gaelic poit’in, meaning “in a pot.” Poteen merely refers to any unlawfully distilled spirit, usu- ally very high in alcohol, colorless, unaged, undis- tinctive but somehow very romantic to drink.

624 MANHATTAN
Besides being a darned good drink, the Manhattan has a rather interesting story to go with it. This cocktail was reportedly developed for Lady Jenny Churchill, a Brooklyn-born woman who married Lord Randolph and gave birth to Winston. The drink was first served at the Manhattan Club in New York, at a banquet given by Lady Jenny in honor of Samuel J. Tilden. Mr. Tilden was a famous lawyer of his time, who prosecuted the Tweed Ring, a group of politicians who stole millions from New York City.
A cherry is the correct garnish for a Manhattan, whereas a twist belongs in a Dry Manhattan; a Per- fect Manhattan can take either. The Manhattan is made with sweet vermouth but should not be called a Sweet Manhattan. There is only a Manhattan, a

Dry Manhattan (page 211), and a Perfect Manhat- tan (page 221).

631 OLD-FASHIONED
The classic Old-Fashioned is made with blended whiskey. The original was concocted at the Pendenis Club in Louisville, Kentucky.
There used to be seven distilleries in Louisville, and it is said that a representative from one of them concocted the drink for a retired Civil War general who didn’t care much for the taste of whiskey, but who, like a good general should, really did enjoy the effect. Fortunately, though the name of the gen- eral and the distillery seem to be lost forever, one longtime employee at the Pendenis does remember that the original Old-Fashioned used branch water, as opposed to tap water. Branch water is merely a southern term for bottled water, so if you are mak- ing the drink for a special occasion, open a bottle of whatever designer water you have around. Americ- an water is preferred, of course.

Variations include the Bourbon Old-Fashioned (page 28) and the Scotch Old-Fashioned (page 152).

10 • TROPICAL DRINKS
What makes a drink tropical? Pineapples, coconuts, orchids, parasols, and plastic monkeys for starters. These exotic potions are guaranteed to transport you to someplace in the Tropics, where vines grow haphazardly around the pillar next to your table and flaming kebabs dance around the dining room in the hands of exotic-looking waiters.
Mai Tais and Zombies are bewitching names for drinks with exceptional ingredients and curious gar- nishes. They are perfect for a poolside party in the dog days of summer, as an accompaniment to a trop- ical theme dinner, or to serve at a cocktail party for some favorite friends.
Tropical drinks usually have two things in com- mon: They are great thirst quenchers, containing

many exotic fruit juices and ice in great quantities, and they can be very high in alcohol content. These two qualities are rarely found in other drinks, which are generally either light thirst quenchers or Bac- chanalian potions.
Try some of these drinks, sit back with the sun beating on your face, and sip them through a long straw while you imagine some Indiana Jones type of character battling through the perils of the jungle to bring you the exotic ingredients that you just took from your refrigerator. It’s a refreshing way to spend a lazy afternoon.

11 • APERITIFS
The word aperitif is actually derived from the Latin word aperire, which means “to open.” Appropri- ately, an aperitif is a drink that is used as an opening to a meal, and many drinks can fall into this category. If you choose to drink a quart of stout as a prelude to dinner, then a quart of stout becomes an aperitif (indeed, 12 ounces of good stout makes for a quite superb opening to a meal). Generally speaking, however, aromatized wines and dry sherries are con- sidered to be proper aperitifs. Since dry sherries are discussed in the Wine Drinks chapter, this chapter will deal just with aromatized wines. Wines can be divided into four categories: still, sparkling, forti- fied, and aromatized.
If you are one of the many people who just can’t abide the taste of coffee without some sugar or arti-

ficial sweetener in it, then you will understand per- fectly how aromatized wines came into being. Sour wine was sweetened with honey or herbs by the ancient Greeks and Romans in order to make it more palatable. The practice of adding herbs to wine in order to preserve their medicinal qualities also played a great part in the creation of aromat- ized wines.
AROMATIZED WINES
Most aromatized wines are a variation on dry ver- mouths with a few distinctions:
1.	They are generally sweeter, containing more mistelle (in simple terms, brandy combined with grape juice).
2.	Red aromatized wines are usually made from a red base wine.
3.	Quinine is generally added in making aro- matized wines.
Examples of popular aromatized wines include: Campari, Dubonnet, Lillet, Cynar, St Raphaël, Punt e Mes, Amer Picon, and Byrrh.
VERMOUTH
Vermouths are aromatized wines, but aromatized wines are not necessarily vermouths. The word ver- mouth comes from the German wermut, which lit- erally means “wormwood.” Italy produced the first vermouth in the late eighteenth century; it was made from white wines infused with herbs to make a sweetish aromatized wine. In the early nineteenth century, a drier version of vermouth was produced in France and ever since, sweet vermouth is known as Italian vermouth and dry vermouth is known as French, even though both Italy and France produce both types of vermouths. Almost every wine-pro- ducing nation makes vermouth of both types, sweet and dry, or Italian and French.
The best dry vermouth is made by adding aged mistelle (see above) to aged white wine. This mix- ture is then steeped with herbs, roots, flowers, spices, fruit peels, and probably a host of other in- gredients. Each company guards their recipes jeal- ously. This infused wine is then cut with basic wine and brandy is added to it. The mixture is put into vats and chilled until the tartaric acid crystallizes. The vermouth is then drained off and bottled.
Sweet vermouth also is made from white wine, usually sweeter white wines, and sweetening agents are added along with quinine and some caramel for coloring.

12 • CORDIALS
In America, a cordial, usually served as an after-din- ner drink, is what the rest of the world calls a li- queur—a sweetened liquor. In most other English- speaking countries, cordials are concentrated fruit juices with no alcoholic content.
Cordials form the base of some well-known cock- tails: the Pink Squirrel, the Apricot Sour, and the Grasshopper. These sweetened liquors were first known to the French as liqueurs de dessert, and they are probably as old as any hill you may care to men- tion. They were originally concocted by the ancient alchemists as potions for medicinal purposes. Infus- ing alcohol with remedial herbs, spices, fruits, and barks was a good way of preserving their medicinal qualities.

Right up until the end of the eighteenth century, people concocted their own liqueurs at home, adding sugar and fruits from their gardens to brandy or whatever other liquor was available.
PRODUCTION
Cordials can be divided into two basic categories: fruit cordials, which can take on the color of the fruit (cherry and blackberry brandy), but may be colorless if made only with the peel or seed of the fruit (triple sec); plant cordials, which are generally colorless (anisette), but can take on the color of one of the herbs and roots used in a blend (Bénédictine and Chartreuse).
The rule governing cordial states that a cordial must contain at least 2 1⁄2 percent sugar of any type. In fact, most of them contain 30 to 40 percent sugar. Cordials are made from any base spirit—rum, gin, vodka, or the like—that is then flavored with fruit, roots, herbs, bark, seeds, flowers, peels, or juices.
The following methods of introducing these flavors differ from one to another and are usually governed by how much time and money the manufacturer wants to spend.
Maceration: Maceration is similar to infusion and simply means that the flavoring agent is immersed in a base spirit until the flavor is absorbed by that spirit. This process can take as long as a year and is used to flavor liquors with ingredients that would lose flavor if heated.
Infusion: In an infusion, the flavoring agent is steeped in a heated base liquor, and the temperature is maintained for several days. The resultant liqueur is very flavorful and much more inexpensive to pro- duce than macerated liqueurs.
Percolation: This method of flavoring liqueurs may employ hot or cold techniques. The flavoring agent is placed in a sievelike container, and the liquor is then either bubbled through it for weeks at a time or boiled underneath it, so that the vapors rise, collect the flavors, and then condense back into the liquor.
Distillation: This method requires an infused liquor to be redistilled, usually under a vacuum in a pot still.
TYPES OF CORDIALS
A list of all known cordials, or liqueurs, with ex- planations of their contents could take up a book in itself. Here are a few of the better-known ones, whose names may require explanation.

13 • WINE DRINKS
It is not known when wine was first made, although the date is sure to have been very early in the career of Homo sapiens. In addition to the numerous ref- erences to wine made in the Old Testament and by the ancient Greeks over 3,000 years ago, there is also evidence, in the form of grape skins and pips, that suggests wine was made by prehistoric man. Pleas- ure, it seems, came early in the life of our species.
Wine can be divided into four categories: still, sparkling, fortified, and aromatized. Since aromat- ized wines are dealt with in the Aperitifs chapter, this section will cover the other three. Still wines can themselves be divided into distinct types: To begin with, there is the obvious red, white, and rosé, or blush. Then consider whether the wine is dry, off-dry (or semidry), or sweet. For purposes of mixing, we

are concerned here with dry wine, which may actu- ally give the illusion of sweetness if it has a lot of fruitiness to it.
If you’re looking for a great bottle of Bordeaux or Cabernet Sauvignon to serve at your dinner party on Saturday night, I refer you to one of the excellent references specializing on fine wines listed in my bibliography at the end of this book. For the bar, I suggest searching your local liquor stores for good quality at a budget price. When it’s going to be a large party, don’t turn up your nose at jug wines. California, Spain, France, and Italy make some quite respectable wines in quantity. When the wine is to be mixed with other flavorings and liquors, the subtleties of a fine vintage will be lost.
The same goes for sparkling wines. A simple Champagne Cocktail does taste best with an ex- cellent bubbly. But when you begin mixing in a number of other flavors, go for good value. Many countries—and in the case of the United States, states—make fine sparkling wines. Experiment
with labels from California, Spain, Italy, and France until you find an inexpensive sparkling wine that has the qualities you enjoy.
Fortified wines include Madeira, port, and sherry. Again, quality and price vary widely, and a fabulously expensive vintage port will be lost in a brew of beverages. Try to find a reliable brand that gives you respectable—but not necessarily excep- tional—quality at a decent price.
Since I’ve told you how other liquors are made, you can read on to learn something about the pro- duction of these three types of wine, or skip to page 297 to get right to the recipes.
PRODUCTION STILL WINE
1. Still wine is simply ordinary noncarbon- ated wine, as opposed to Champagne and
other sparkling wines. The grapes are picked and taken to a pressing house, where they are mechanically or manually pressed and destemmed, producing a “must” that is placed in a fermenting vat.
2.	If white wine is being made, the skins are removed from the must. Red wines take their color from the grape skins, which also release tannin into the wine. Rosé wines are made by leaving the skins in the must for a short period, to impart some color.
3.	Thefermentationvatsaresealedtoprevent oxidization, and fermentation begins utiliz- ing either natural yeast that is present on the grapes or yeast added by the wine- maker.
4.	Fermentation stops when the yeast dies, that is, when all of the sugar has been util- ized by the yeast. In the case of sweet wines, however, some sugar remains in the wine after the yeast dies.
5.	Thewineisthenstoredinhugewoodenor stainless steel vats, to age and settle. After
about six months the wine is racked, that is, drawn off into fresh wooden casks, leaving behind a residue known as the lees.
6.	The wine is racked three times during the next year. After the final racking the wine is left to age in wooden casks for periods that differ from wine to wine, winemaker to winemaker.
7.	The wine is bottled and shipped or stored for further aging.
CHAMPAGNE
1.	Theredorwhitegrapesareharvestedwhen fully ripe and taken to pressing houses, where they are pressed twice. The resultant juice, called the cuvée, is used only for the best Champagnes.
2.	The cuvée is stored at a constant temper- ature while it undergoes its first fermenta- tion. The fermented wine is drawn off into
fresh casks, leaving the lees behind, and is
chilled to remove bitartrates.
3.	Afterafewmonthsthewineispumpedin-
to blending vats, where it is combined with sugar and yeast to conform with its maker’s style. The wine is then bottled, corked, and capped with metal caps similar to those on a beer bottle.
4.	Thebottlesarestoredontheirsides,inspe- cial racks located in chalk caves. Here, the wine undergoes a secondary fermentation due to the added yeast and sugar.
5.	During this secondary fermentation sedi- ment appears in the bottle. To collect it and prevent its marring the wine, the bottles are gradually tilted and turned so that the sedi- ment falls onto the bottom of the cork.
6.	The neck of the bottle is frozen and the metal cup removed. The cork explodes from the bottle, taking the frozen sediment with it. Sweetened mature wine is added to the bottle, and it is recorked for shipping or storage.
FORTIFIED WINE
Quite simply, this term applies to wine that has been fortified with brandy. Since each type of for- tified wine differs from the next, I will briefly de- scribe each of the main varieties.
MADEIRA
Made in Madeira, a tiny island off the coast of Por- tugal, Madeira is made from fermented grape juice that is fortified with locally produced brandy and then stored at temperatures of up to 140°F for three to six months.
PORT
From the Douro region of Portugal, port is made by adding brandy to wine that is still in the process of fermentation. This halts the process, retaining the sugar not yet used by the yeast and resulting in a sweet fortified wine.
Vintage Port is port that the winemaker decides is good enough to call vintage. It must be bottled within two years and should then be aged in the
bottle for between 8 and 20 years. These ports have specially treated corks that will not deteriorate quickly, since the bottles are laid down on their sides.
Tawny Port is aged in casks and is repeatedly “fined,” that is, clarified by using substances such as egg whites to collect sediment that is suspended in the liquid. This process also takes some of the color out of the port; hence, the longer it is aged, the paler (or tawnier) and drier it becomes.
Ruby Port is not aged for as long as the tawny. It re- tains much of its original color, fruitiness, and full body.
White Port is made only from white grapes, but it is aged in wooden casks like the ruby and tawny ports and is a drier wine than its sisters.
SHERRY
The word sherry is simply an Anglicized version of Jerez, the town around which sherry is produced in the Cadiz region of Spain. Wine is produced from
local grapes that are fermented and aged. The wine is then drawn off into casks that are not filled to ca- pacity. At this stage a yeast scum, known as flor, should appear on the sherry. The scum is produced by a local, airborne yeast that sometimes develops and sometimes doesn’t—it’s totally up to Mother Nature. The amount of flor that develops will in- dicate to the winemaker which type of sherry he should produce. At this point he can add the brandy that fortifies the sherry.
Fino (pale, light, and dry) sherry is produced when the scum develops fully.
Manzanilla (dry and crisp) sherry is a fino type that has been aged in the coastal town of Sanlucar de Barrameda.
Amontillado (dry and nutty) sherry results when the flor develops only partially.
Oloroso (dark, heavy-bodied, and usually sweetened for export) sherry is produced when the flor does not develop at all. Extra brandy is added
if the flor doesn’t look like it will develop, ensuring a batch of oloroso.
Amoroso sherry also known as cream or brown sherry (sweet), is an oloroso type with sweet wine added.
STORAGE OF WINES
Any white wine—still or sparkling—can be stored unopened in a refrigerator for up to a few months. When storing red wine or white wine for longer periods, however, certain standards should be fol- lowed:
Wine should ideally be stored in a dark place at a temperature of no lower than 50° to 55°F. As a general rule the temperature in a wine- storage area should never exceed more than 70°F for wines that will be stored up to 5 years, 65°F if the wine is to be stored for up to 15 years, and 60°F for any period exceeding 15 years.
Humidity in a wine storage area should be kept at around 50 percent in order to prevent cork deterioration and mustiness.
Still and sparkling wines should be stored on their sides in order to keep the corks moist. This prevents air from entering the bottle and, in the case of sparkling wines, gas from escap- ing.
Except for vintage port, which is specially corked, fortified wines should be kept upright since their high alcohol content can damage the cork.
Once the bottle is opened...
HOW TO SERVE WINE
TEMPERATURES
The first rule regarding wine temperature is that wine should be drunk at whatever temperature pleases you most. Having said that, I will now tell you the generally accepted norms of wine temper- atures.
White wines should be chilled to between 40° and 50°F. Red wines and fortified wines should be served at room temperature, between 63° and 66°F.
OPENING THE BOTTLE
When selecting a corkscrew, use the type that makes you feel most comfortable. Once a bottle of fine wine is opened it should be drunk immediately. When using cheaper bottles or jug wine for mixed drinks, it is not unheard of to keep an opened bottle for up to a week in the refrigerator, although you should check it, like a good host, before serving. Here’s the proper way to open a corked bottle of wine:
1.	Removethefoilcoveringfromtheneckof the bottle by cutting it with a knife right be- low the bulge on the neck of the bottle.
2.	Wipe off the neck of the bottle to remove any mold that may have developed between the foil and the bottle.
3.	Remove the cork gently and smoothly. If you jerk the bottle you may disturb sedi- ment in the wine.
4.	After removing the cork wipe the neck again, both inside and out.
For bar wines, especially jugs, you will often find that all you have to do is to unscrew the top.
For sparkling wines:
1.	Untwistthewirelocatedontheneckofthe bottle and remove it along with the cage that it forms over the cork and the foil that covers the cage.
2.	Immediately cover the cork with your thumb to prevent it from flying out.
3.	Hold the bottle at a 45-degree angle away from your face and not pointing toward any guest. Serious accidents have occurred with flying corks.
4.	Twistthebottlewithonehandwhilehold- ing the cork with the other. The cork should pop out in your hand, not explode to the far reaches of the room.
5.	Keepthebottleatthe45-degreeanglefora few seconds to help prevent the wine from gushing out of the bottle.
6.	Wipe the neck of the bottle, inside and out.
POURING WINE
It could be argued that wine is best enjoyed glugged straight from the bottle while sitting on the ground outside Notre Dame with a loaf of bread and a hunk of good Gruyère. However, if you wish to follow some basic rules of wine etiquette, they are:
1. Wine should be sampled first by the host. If, after a few seconds, he is not writhing
on the floor, the guests may be served. Ac- tually the custom of wine being tasted by the host first was originally to prove to his guests that he was not trying to poison them, a popular practice in the Middle Ages. These days, of course, the host takes a sip from his glass, which he should fill only about one-quarter full, to ensure that the wine is in good condition before serving his guests.
2.	The wine can then be poured, from the right side of the guest, to fill about one- third to one-half of the glass. When pour- ing, the glass should remain on the table. Do not pick it up to bring it to the bottle.
3.	The bottle should be twisted slightly after pouring each glass so that the drop of wine lingering on the rim of the bottle coats the rim instead of dropping into the lap of the guest as the bottle is removed.
4.	Chilled wines may be kept cold in a wine bucket filled with ice and water. Drape a napkin around the neck of the bottle so that
it can be wiped free of dripping water when
it is removed for pouring.
5. When pouring sparkling wines, first pour
enough wine into the glass so that the froth reaches the top, allow the froth to subside, and then fill the glass.

14 • BEER AND BEER
CONCOCTIONS
Although drinks made with beer are not referred to as cocktails, there are some recipes in this chapter, such as the Black and Tan and the Snake Bite, that make for some very interesting drinking. The history of beer is anything but brief. The ancient Egyptians brewed beer 6,000 years ago; it has been brewed by every society on every continent since then, and—who knows?—probably before then. Beer is an alcoholic beverage that is available to people who have an abundance of grain but are without plentiful amounts of fruit for making wine. Beer is the ancest- or of whiskey, which, in very simple terms, is just distilled beer.
It is very doubtful that brewing beer predates winemaking, but it can safely be said that beer has

been with us for as long as civilized man has been around. The practice of putting hops into beer for flavor was probably introduced by the Dutch in the fifteenth century. The addition of these leaves from the mulberry family served not only to flavor the beer, but also acted as a preservative.
Beer was brought to the United States by the Pil- grims and was brewed by individual households. The first large commercial brewery was owned by William Penn, the founder of Pennsylvania.
PRODUCTION
1.	Barleyismalted,thatis,germinatedtopro- duce an enzyme that can convert the rest of the starch into fermentable sugar.
2.	Themaltisroastedtostopthegermination process. Roasting takes place for different lengths of time depending on what type of beer is being brewed. The longer the malt
is roasted, the darker the malt and, hence,
the darker the beer.
3.	The roasted malt is then ground into grist
and mixed with water and other cooked cereals in a mash tun, where the starches are converted into fermentable sugars.
4.	The mash is stirred within the mash tun, dissolving soluble material from the malt and cereals. The amount of time given to this stirring determines the amount of sol- ubles absorbed into the water and therefore governs the end product.
5.	The mash is transferred to a lauter tun, which has moving rakes that move it around, further breaking down the grist and cereal. When the rakes stop, the grist falls to the bottom, and the liquid, now called “wort,” sieves through it and through the slotted base of the tun.
6.	Hops are added to the wort in a brewing kettle. It is boiled and then strained to re- move the hops.
7.	The hot wort is cooled and put into a fer- menting vat where brewer’s yeast is added and the beer is allowed to ferment. Some brewer’s yeast ferments on the top of the wort and produces ale, while others fer- ment on the bottom and result in lager.
8.	Finallythebeeriscooledinstoragevatsin order to separate it from the yeast and other solids still present, and carbonated.
LAGERS
Lagers are differentiated by the types of yeasts used in making them and are aged for longer periods than ales. They are light in body and can be divided into several types:
PILSNER
The only true Pilsner is brewed in Pilsen, Czechoslovakia. It is flowery and dry. The word
Pilsner on any beer not from Pilsen merely implies that the style of Pilsen beer has been copied.
BOCK
Dark, strong, and sweet, Bock beer can be, although rarely is, top fermented, when it becomes an ale.
MALT LIQUOR
A term applied to any malt beverage that is too high in alcohol content to be defined as a beer within the legal limits of any given state.
ALES
Generally described as having a full body and a heavy hop flavor, ale is top fermented and can be divided into several types:
STOUT
Dark, very malty, and rather bitter, stout has roasted barley added to it for color and flavor.
PORTER
Basically stout with a lower alcohol content, porter is known for having a rich coffeelike flavor.
BITTER
Also known as amber ale, it is flavored heavily with hops. Bitter ale derives its name from its bitter taste.
BROWN ALE
Sweet and dark in color.
CREAM ALE
A light-bodied ale, sometimes blended with a lager.
SCOTCH ALE
Dark and heavily flavored with malt, brewed in Scotland.
PALE ALE
Light-colored ale, often a bottled variety of bitter.
MILD
Lightly hopped, sweeter ale, dark in color.
BARLEY WINE
Usually sold in six-ounce bottles, this dark, strong, sweet ale is usually too high in alcohol to be desig- nated an ale, although it is top-fermented beer.
SAKE
Although saké is usually known as a rice wine, it is in the literal sense a beer. Made from rice that is fer- mented twice, with a different yeast used each time, saké is a clear uncarbonated beer with a high alco- hol content. It is traditionally served warm in small Japanese cups known as sakazuki.

15 • HOT DRINKS
Irish Coffee, Hot Buttered Rum, Tom and Jerry: I think that these drinks stir a memory in most of us—a memory of a certain Christmas with the whole family present, sitting around a roaring log fire with a group of friends on a skiing trip, or maybe sneak- ing into a bar on an icy, windy afternoon to savor a hot drink before carrying on with the chores of the day.
One of my favorite memories of the coastal town where I was raised is that of the cold and blustery days when the rain actually did come down in tor- rents, and the Irish Sea would cascade over the sea walls onto the promenade. On these days, I would don my warmest and most weatherproof clothes, slip a small flask of dark rum into my pocket, and go for a solitary stroll with the sea. After walking for about

20 minutes along the shore, I would make my way, drenched to the bone, to a small, seedy café on Nutter Road (that always seemed quite appropriate) and order a hot malted milk. I would slip the rum into my drink and wrap my hands around the mug, trying to get some feeling back into them, and let the vapors of hot rum and malted milk rise to my nose. In my fantasy I had braved the elements and survived, and this was my reward.
The secret to making good hot drinks is a simple one: Don’t skimp. Don’t use whipped cream on an Irish Coffee if you can lay your hands on some cold heavy cream to pour gently over the back of a tea- spoon. When the drink is made, spend some time enjoying the aroma; savor the whole experience of the drink. It will warm the cockles of your heart.

16 • PARTY PUNCHES
The recipes in this chapter are for classic punches—Glögg, Wassail, and Fish House Punch—that are made in quantity to serve large groups of people. Drinks like the popular Planter’s Punch, which is usually made individually, can be found in the appropriate liquor chapters (Rum for Plants Punch).
There are two explanations for the origin of the word punch. One says that it is just an abbreviation of the word puncheon, which is a huge cask that holds about 70 gallons of liquid (although the amount varies depending on what part of the world you are in). The more likely explanation, however, is that it comes from the Hindu or Persian word panch, which means “five,” and denotes that at least five in- gredients are present.

The oldest-known punch is a rum punch made in Jamaica in the mid-seventeenth century that was simply rum, sugar, water, and orange juice. I know that there are only four ingredients there, but that’s the way history is. It offers sound and logical ex- planations one minute and tears them down the next. Maybe punch got its name from the way it hits you.
Serving punch at a party puts less strain on the host or hostess. It can be made in advance and there is no need for a bartender to make lots of differ- ent drinks for everybody. If you are serving punch, however, make sure that you have some nonalco- holic drinks available for the folks who like to stay sober.
Punch should be served in a bowl with a large block of ice in it to keep it chilled; ice cubes water down the punch, since they dissolve quickly. The block of ice can be made simply by taking the metal dividers out of your ice tray, or just by freezing wa- ter in a well-cleaned milk or juice carton.

17 • NONALCOHOLIC
DRINKS
As mentioned in the introduction to this book, not drinking alcohol is much more common these days. The non-drinkers among us should be catered to. For the past few years more and more celebrities have come forth admitting their addiction to booze. Betty Ford was one of the first, and many other well- known figures have followed. These people have helped to take the stigma away from alcoholism, making it much easier for recovering alcoholics to function in a society that no longer thinks those who have drinking problems are merely weak willed or simply irresponsible. I dedicate this chapter to the brave folk in the public eye who have come forth and bared their souls, showing the general public that even the most upstanding citizen can fall prey to the disease of alcoholism.

I would also like to take time here to mention that if a person tells you that they don’t drink alcohol, then you should take some steps to make sure that you don’t serve them any by accident. One of the most common mistakes is to add bitters to a glass of tonic water or club soda along with a wedge of lime. While this makes a rather refreshing cocktail, bitters usually contain about 50 percent alcohol and should be avoided by the strict teetotaler. The trick is to read all labels; they will tell you how much al- cohol, if any, is contained in a product. Nonalcohol- ic beers and wines all contain a trace of alcohol, al- though, by law, it must be less than one-half of one percent. Check with your nondrinking guest before you serve it.
On the lighter side now, this chapter contains dozens of nonalcoholic drinks, some old standards like the Shirley Temple, along with some lesser- known drinks, such as a Flying Fairbrother and a favorite Indian concoction called a Lassi. If you are throwing a party, plan to have something dif- ferent for your nondrinking friends to quaff. Try to
remember that, if they used to drink, they would probably prefer something not too sweet—say, homemade lemonade or store-bought ginger beer.

18 • VERSATILE COCKTAILS
A bone of contention has arisen over the root of the word cocktail, an interesting name for a mixture of beverages, don’t you think? Here, then, are some of the possible origins of the word:
1.	A derivation of the French word coquetier, or a double-sided egg cup that was used by a New Orleans pharmacist for serving mixed drinks.
2.	A derivation of the phrase “cock your tail”, meaning “keep your spirits up”.
3.	A pro-Revolutionary tavern keeper during the War of Independence stole chickens from a nearby farm owned by British sym- pathizers to feed Washington’s troops. She used the feathers from the chickens to gar- nish the drinks in her tavern and was toasted by French-speaking customers, who

shouted, “Vive le cocktail!” That’s really
farfetched.
4. It used to be customary to dock the tail of
horses of mixed breed so that they would not be confused with the thoroughbreds. These horses were then known as being “cocktailed”. Since a cocktail is a mixture of liquors but is not “pure” in itself, mixed drinks became known as cocktails. This one gets my vote.
Here is a handy little list of versatile cocktails that can be made with a variety of liquors. These drinks are mostly classics from the Twenties and Thirties that have survived the test of time. Differ- ences among them are often slight, but you abso- lutely must know the difference between a Daisy and a Fancy if you want to impress. All of these generic recipes appear as specific drinks elsewhere in the book.

HIGHBALL
What is a highball? Well, first, it’s a drink that is served in a highball glass; second, it’s quick to
make; and third, it’s whatever liquor you desire mixed with water or soda. Of these three qualities, speed is the most important.
In the nineteenth century, when a train was run- ning behind schedule, a ball would be placed high up on a tall pole in the railway station to signal the driver and engineer to travel at full speed. Hence, the term highball was first connected to speed and was later given to a drink that can be made quickly. The basic rules of a highball are:
Use only one liquor.
Use only one mixer.
Use only one garnish or none at all. Make the drink quickly.
Examples of a Highball include a Bourbon and Branch (page 24), Brandy and Soda (page 45), Gin and Tonic (page 73), and Scotch and Water (page 151).
